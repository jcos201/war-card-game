## About This Game
:spades: :hearts: :diamonds: :clubs: \
 \
War is a card game I used to play as a kid.  When given the task of creating my first app I though it'd be nice to create something my own kids could play.  So I set out to create this simple game that even a child could play.

## Rules

## Wireframe
!(Wireframe) (https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/4068607a-05c1-4f3e-adfd-9a76b811cd2f)
###This was my original wireframe, as you can see from the screenshots below there has been some formatting changes since the original concept.  During testing it seemed that a better user experience could be attained by changing the layout slightly.
